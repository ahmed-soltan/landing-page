          <h1>Repairs Over Replacement</h1>
          <p>We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in mind. That's why we believe it's always worth trying
             to fix a system before outright replacing it, wherever possible – it requires fewer materials and is easier on the planet,
              as well as your wallet! If another company tells you that 
            your system needs to be replaced, just give us a call and we'll see if we can repair it first.</p>

          <p>Price
            As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems don't tend to come cheap. Our aim is to make solar power accessible to everyone, so we price ourselves in a way that makes solar energy more affordable. We're focused on helping you and on helping the environment, rather than on turning a profit.</p>

          <p>As we've said, we do this because we truly care about the planet and about seeing people embrace a greener, more eco-friendly approach to power. The world of green energy can be jargon-filled and opaque, so we want to help educate people on the big and little things they can do to protect our planet!</p>
